# employee-tracker
The goal of this SQL challenge is to construct a command-line application to manage a company's database.  Upon opening the terminal, a user will be prompted to answer if they would like to 1) view all employees, 2) view all roles, or 3) view all departments.
##
The tools used for this project include Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.  The MySQL2 package was used to connect to the MySQL database, and Inquirer was used to interact with the user via the command-line.
